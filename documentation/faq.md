# Frequently asked questions

**Q:** Why does this template provide a reference implementation instead of a naked logic-free project?

**A:**
Logic-free templates are good to scaffold an initial blank structure of a new project.
Reference implementation goes a step further and proposes organizational and technical decisions for architecture, code design, data flow and other things.
This template represents a complete project, so all its suggested workflows and implementation details can be checked right away out-of-box.
It works as an example that can be transformed, refactored and supplemented into a state that represents a solid base for developing real projects.

##
